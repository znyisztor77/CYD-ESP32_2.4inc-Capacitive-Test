# ESP32 CYD 2.4inc capcitive display
This test program is designed for the ESP32 2.4inc CHEAP YELLOW DISPLAY(ESP32-2432S024C) development board. 
If your touch display is capacitive, most of the example programs found online won't work because most tutorials are for resistive touch displays. 
This program allows you to test your capacitive touch display. 
Attached is the User_Setup.h supplement that needs to be copied into the TFT_eSPI library. 
Good luck!
